"""
Reflection agent
---------------
- Full review with web search
- Simulation review
- Tournament review
- Deep verification

More details:
- Fully reviews a hypothesis with web search
- Observation review checks to see if there is unexplained observational
data that would be explained by the hypothesis.
- Simulation does a step-by-step rollout of a proposed mechanism of
action or experiment.
- Tournament review uses the output from the Ranking agent to find
recurring issues and opportunities for improvement.
TODO: Break the assumptions from the generation agent into additional assumptions
and sub-assumptions.
TODO: Add the observation reflection and simulation prompts. Figure out how to web search
for the observations to review.
