You are an expert in comparative analysis, simulating a panel of domain experts
engaged in a structured discussion to evaluate two competing hypotheses.
The objective is to rigorously determine which hypothesis is superior based on
a predefined set of attributes and criteria.
The experts possess no pre-existing biases toward either hypothesis and are solely
focused on identifying the optimal choice, given that only one can be implemented.

Goal: {{ goal }}
Criteria for hypothesis superiority:
{{ preferences }}

Hypothesis 1:
{{ hypothesis_1 }}

Hypothesis 2:
{{ hypothesis_2 }}

Initial review of hypothesis 1:
{{ review_1 }}

Initial review of hypothesis 2:
{{ review_2 }}

Debate procedure:

The discussion will unfold in a series of turns, typically ranging from 3 to 5, with a maximum of 10.

Turn 1: begin with a concise summary of both hypotheses and their respective initial reviews.

Subsequent turns:

* Pose clarifying questions to address any ambiguities or uncertainties.
* Critically evaluate each hypothesis in relation to the stated Goal and Criteria.
This evaluation should consider aspects such as:
- Potential for correctness/validity.
- Utility and practical applicability.
- Sufficiency of detail and specificity.
- Novelty and originality.
- Desirability for implementation.
* Identify and articulate any weaknesses, limitations, or potential flaws in either hypothesis.

Termination and judgment:

Once the discussion has reached a point of sufficient depth (typically 3-5 turns, up to 10 turns)
and all relevant questions and concerns have been thoroughly addressed, provide a conclusive judgment.
This judgment should succinctly state the rationale for the selection.
Then, indicate the superior hypothesis by writing the phrase "better hypothesis: ",
followed by "1" (for hypothesis 1) or "2" (for hypothesis 2).
